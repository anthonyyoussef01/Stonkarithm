Treat $NIO as a 5 year term deposit.  Return is 1000%.


$NIO at smh $35 per share. If this were an American company it would be three digits right now.

China invests in #bitcoin

China invests in #bitcoin


#BITCOIN WILL HIT $100,000 BEFORE IT HITS $200,000! Both will happen in 2021.. 🚀

Not owning bitcoin is just irresponsible at this point in history


NIO will saturate the Chinese market with their charging and battery swap infrastructure that other carmakers almost won’t have a choice but to work with them. Genius. $NIO

$FUBO 👀


$btc HODL!

$COIN

It has 261.3 million outstanding shares, valuing the company at $85 billion.

1. They had $335 billion volume with $1.8 billion revenue and $800 million net income, that is 40% profit margin after all the expenses for just 1st quarter which is impressive.

$TSLA now pulling back to 4 EMA. I think high chance it could bounce from here. Good time to add.

Those April 23, 770c are now $12.5. (Could add 1/4 )


Do not do what everyone is doing, because the money might have already been made there. Find plays that are undervalued, ignore and let everyone come to you. $CCIV $FUBO
