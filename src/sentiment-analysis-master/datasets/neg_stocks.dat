Robinhood Announces You Can No Longer Open GME/AMC Positions For Friday. ðŸ˜±



GME and AMC are dead, and here's why.


Tell me you are not all absolute pussies as I watch AMC plummet. No heart. No hope. Should have watched a Rocky Movie before investing your monies. ðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆ who is still in there?

Starting to think AMC might not go to $420.69


Why I am Bearish on $AMC until at least May



Sold all my AMC



Stop trying to make AMC happen. It was never shorted over 140% let alone 100%, doesnt have RC or DFV, not changing their business model into ecommerce like gme

i hate $AAPL


$AAPL will now dip


$TSLA -2% today as traders again worry about inflation (10yr Treas yld 1.64% +3 bp), realizing that pause in JNJ vaccine is not going to slow re-opening ($QQQ -0.7%, re-opening names up). Other issue: Potentially high $COIN valuation, indicated at $355/share (~12x FYâ€™21E Revs).


577,000+ block share sell at the close. That's some big money. Wow. $TSLA
